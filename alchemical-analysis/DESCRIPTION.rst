Alchemical Analysis
=======================

Analyze alchemical free energy calculations conducted in GROMACS, AMBER or SIRE
using recommended best practices from Klimovich et al., JCAMD 29:397-411
(2015). This tool handles analysis via a slate of free energy methods, including BAR,
MBAR, TI, and the Zwanzig relationship (exponential averaging) among others,
and provides a good deal of analysis of computed free energies and convergence
in order to help you assess the quality of your results.
